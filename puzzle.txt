Once upon a time, there was a princess in a far away land.

The beautiful, young princess had a dilemma. She was in love with Igor, the blacksmith's son. She wanted to marry him.

However, she knew that her father, the king, would not approve. Furthermore, if the king knew of their love, he would surely have the young man executed.

So the young lovers devise a plan. They will elope. Sadly, their plan is foiled, and they are stopped at the castle gates by the guards.

They are brought before the king. Now the king was indeed furious, but decided to offer Igor a sporting chance. He said he would write the word Princess on one piece of paper and Death on another, and the young lad could decide his own fate by selecting one of the slips of paper from a jar. The two slips were crumbled up, throw into a jar.

And young Igor's fate in his own hands. If he picks out Princess, he gets the princess, if he picks out Death, he gets death.

However, the king was sneaky and he writes the word Death on both pieces of paper. 

Despite the king's trickery, Igor manages to win the princess's hand.

And the puzzler question is, how did he thwart the king?
